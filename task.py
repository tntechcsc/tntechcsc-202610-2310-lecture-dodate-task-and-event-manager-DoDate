'''
The Task class represents an actionable to-do item. Tasks have descriptive information 
and a status (incomplete, in progress, completed).

# TODO: create a Task class
    # TODO: write a constructor with the attributes task_name, todays_focus, description, 
    #       due_date, status, weight, steps, and category_name. Each of these attributes 
    #       will be passed in as arguments. They should be set to each of the attributes accordingly.

    # Write the getters and setters for each of the attributes. They must have the format
    #       "get_attributeName" or "set_attributeName"

    # TODO: write a method called to_dict. This method should return a Task object that has been
    #       converted into a dictionary where each of the attribute names and its corresponding 
    #       value turned into a key-value pair. The dictionary keys should be the exact same as the
    #       attribute names.

    # TODO: write a static method called from_dict which accepts a dictionary object as an argument.
    #       Each entry in the dictionary corresponds to a Task attribute. Create and return a Task 
    #       object using the data extracted from the dictionary.
