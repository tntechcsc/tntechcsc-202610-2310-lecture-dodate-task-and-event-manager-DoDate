# TODO: create a Category class
    # TODO: write a constructor with the attributes category_name and description. Each of these attributes 
    #       will be passed in as arguments. They should be set to each of the attributes accordingly.

    # TODO: write the getters and setters for each of the attributes. They must have the format
    #       "get_attributeName" or "set_attributeName"

    # TODO: write a method called to_dict. This method should return a Category object that has been
    #       converted into a dictionary where each of the attribute names and its corresponding 
    #       value turned into a key-value pair. The dictionary keys should be the exact same as the
    #       attribute names.

    # TODO: write a static method called from_dict which accepts a dictionary object as an argument.
    #       Each entry in the dictionary corresponds to a Category attribute. Create and return a Category 
    #       object using the data extracted from the dictionary.
